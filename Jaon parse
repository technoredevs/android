With so many mobiles to choose from, finding the best smartphones in 2021 can be a daunting undertaking. You could go with the safe bet at a high price – Apple’s iPhone 12 Pro Max, or one of its siblings, the iPhone 12 or 12 mini.

There's so much to choose from – so we've done the research and tested hundreds of Android and iOS devices to bring you our best smartphones list.

The first thing you need to ask yourself is – what’s your priority? If you’re after a champion camera phone, then you’ll want to check out our round up of the best camera phones. For a creative powerhouse, maybe you’d be more interested in Samsung’s latest Galaxy S21 Ultra with its amazing screen, super versatile cameras and S Pen support. Alternatively, there are other lower-cost options from the likes of OnePlus if all you want is premium hardware without the pen input.

Before picking up any phone, remember to check that the best iPhone apps and Android apps for creatives are available. If you’re jumping from an iPhone to and Android, for example, the stellar Good Notes won’t be an option on Google’s mobile OS. 

Once you’ve cross-checked your must-have apps and know which OS you need, our list of top-ten creative phones should help you figure out which is the right device for your personal life, productivity, work and everything in between.

Beautiful display

Solid camera

Battery life could be better

Base storage low

The iPhone 12 has a 6.1in display and has the same 5G support as Apple’s other new iPhones, along with very good (but not the absolute best) camera performance. The OLED screen is a joy to behold, and the new MagSafe feature is an intriguing addition to Apple’s arsenal.

Fantastic camera software

Handsome, minimal design

No telephoto camera

Night shots could be better

The Google Pixel 5 isn’t a phone that blows you away with fancy multiple lenses. It keeps things simple with a 12.2MP main camera and a 16MP  ultra-wide one, with no dedicated zoom lens. 

Power-wise, things are middling too, with a Snapdragon 765G processor, and 8GB of RAM. On paper, then, the Pixel 5 isn’t up there with the most powerful, feature-packed phone in the word, but its price fairly reflects that. 

What it does do, is offer a pure up to date Android experience in a smart minimal package, with solid well-lit camera performance and powerful image editing tools for tweaking on the move, with a battery that will  comfortably last you through the day.

If you want to keep up with the latest Android features for the next few years and aren’t fussed about night or zoom photography, this could very well be the best handset for you."

"title":"Oppo Find X2 Pro",
"message":"Oppo has been relatively unknown until recently, but it landed with a bang. Last year, its branding was all over Wimbledon, and now it’s launched one of the best smartphones of the year so far, the Find X2 Pro.

From a camera point of view, the X2 Pro wows, introducing Sony’s second-generation 48MP sensor to the world. Grabbing high-resolution photos with beautiful depth and plenty of detail, the great thing about photos shot on the Find X2 Pro is that they look natural and realistic, especially when set aside those captured on Samsung phones. Packing a 5x zoom telephoto camera, the Pro also gets you close to the action, and its ultra-wide camera is a pin-sharp 48MP, for GoPro-esque shots you can crop into."
